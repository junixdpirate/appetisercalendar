Demo Project: Calendar Event

Created By: Vivencio (Jhun) Tiballa

Hours spent to completion: 12 hours

Details:

I used VueJS in the calendar event UI for reactivity. Post data are submitted using axios.

Before doing the test:

run composer install to updates libraries and dependecies

run migration. It will create the table calendar_event used for saving the event.
